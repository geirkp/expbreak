\refpoint{1.One is the effects of deformed beach as discussed in the last paragraph on page 6. If the systematic depression along the centreline is significant enough to cause the pronounced transverse variation of runup, authors may also have to report runup value averaged over the transverse direction as well as the maximum value.}

For the non breaking wave $\alpha =0.10$, an traverse field of view average runup height is added in the manuscript. In the breaking wave cases the shoreline deformation was too large, such that only pieces of the shoreline was captured in the field of views. An average of the captured shoreline would therefore be misleading and are not included.
